<h1>Assesment mode bypass (bookmarklet)</h1>

<p>The 'Assesment mode bypass' extention works, but can't be installed on school computers becuase they disallow extentions.</p>

<p>A much older and less well known way to inject javascript into a site is the <code>javascipt</code> url.</p>

<p>Due to security conserns, these url must be manualy navigated to, like with a bookmark.</p>

<p>I have taken the code of the "assesment mode bypass" extention and put it in a javascript url, which you can bookmark by dragging the link.</p>

<p>Drag this link into the title bar - <a href='javascript:o=chrome.runtime.sendMessage;f=(i,d,c)=>{if(i=="lojeahlfbkkiopgolmojagpemoflmkhn"){if(c){c({message:"success"});}return;}else{o(i,d,c)}};window.chrome.runtime.sendMessage=f;alert("all done!");'>Bypass lockdown mode</a>

<p>To use it, click on the bookmark right before pressing the start button.</p>
